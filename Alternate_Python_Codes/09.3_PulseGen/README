There are 2 versions of the same program:
pulseGenGUI.py reads the designer file pulseGen.ui
pulseGenGUIV2.py imports pulseGen_Ui.py which has been automatically created from pulseGen.ui using:
pyuic5 pulseGen.ui -o pulseGen_Ui.py
The latter method allows to easily create a binary with all libraries included using pyinstaller
